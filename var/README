- Think $JASP_DIR as a placeholder for the directory where tar was extracted

    1. Build jaspinteg
       ( g++ and make are required )

       - Enter jaspinteg directory << cd $JASP_DIR/jaspinteg >>
       - Seup environment << make setup >>
       - Build Library << make command=release >>
       - Install Library << sudo make install command=release >>

    2. Build jaspext
       ( php5-dev is required )

       - Enter jaspext directory << cd $JASP_DIR/jaspext >>
       - Phpize environment << phpize >>
       - Configure build << ./configure --with-jaspext >>
       - Build extension << make >>
       - Install extension << sudo make install >>

    3. Add extension

       - Add the line "extension=jaspext.so" to the end of apache's php.ini (usually located at /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini)
       - Restart Apache << /etc/init.d/apache2 restart >>

    4. Start Jasper-Server

       - Enter server directory << cd $JASP_DIR/jaspServer/bin >>
       - Start Daemon << ./jasp_server.sh start >>

Note: The Jasper-Server is thought to be a daemon. It's easily possible and desired to add a Init-Script for it
      and make the symlinks for the desired runlevels. There is such a script in $JASP_DIR/jaspServer/scripts
      called jasp_server. In Ubuntu you have to copy it to your /etc/init.d and replace the variable JASP_DIR with
      the correct location. To create the symlinks for the run-levels you can use the command
      << rc-update.d jasp_server defaults >>.
